      Description:'"Liberation movements seldom serve their purpose if the mind of the individual is not liberated." Acharya Prashant’s book "Stree" explores this profound truth, particularly in the context of the Women`s Liberation Movement. While this movement aims to provide political and social equality to women, it often fails to address the root cause of all enslavement: the state of the mind. The objectification of women leads to their subjugation. The world exploits women by reducing them to mere physical objects, and women cannot fight this exploitation as long as they remain identified with their physicality. Acharya Prashant elucidates the rightful place of the body and its urges, illuminating the path to the liberation of the feminine mind. In the author`s words, "A woman rises from being an object of lust to a deity worth worshiping when she drops her womanliness." "Stree" is an invaluable resource for those seeking true inner freedom and a deeper understanding of feminine liberation. This book by Acharya Prashant in hindi is more than a self help and motivational book and is a must read for every woman.',

Natasha, Riya, Anjali and Katherine were best friends in college - each different from the other yet inseparable - until that night. It was the night that began with a bottle of whisky and a game of Ouija but ended with the death of Sania, their unlikeable hostel mate. The friends vowed never to discuss that fateful night, a pact that had kept their friendship and guilt dormant for the last twenty years. But now, someone has begun to mess with them, threatening to reveal the truth that only Sania knew. Is it a hacker playing on their guilt or has Sania`s ghost really returned to avenge her death? As the faceless enemy closes in on them, the friends come together once again to recount what really happened that night. But when the story is retold by each of them, the pieces don`t fit. Because none of them is telling the whole truth . . . That Night is a dark, twisted tale of friendship and betrayal that draws you in and confounds you at every turn.',

      Description:'The Magic is the third book by Rhonda Byrne. This is the Hindi translation of the book, and is called Jadoo. In this work, Rhonda emphasizes the significance of being grateful for all the blessings one has in his/her life.Summary of the BookJadoo explains how conveying gratitude for everything we have will invite more good things into our lives. She also asserts that those who fail in being thankful for their blessings will lose all that they have. Expressing gratitude makes a person realize all the good things they are blessed with in life, instead of concentrating only on the negatives. This in turn can nurture optimistic outlooks and make the person more positive and cheerful in life. The Magic or Jadoo thus serves as a manual for refining one’s perspectives and directions for a better life.',

      Description:'Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness doing well with money isn?t necessarily about what you know. It?s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters',

      Description:'SPECIAL 10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION with exclusive extra behind-the-scenes material from the author It is 1939. In Nazi Germany, the country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier - and will become busier still. By her brother`s graveside, Liesel`s life is changed forever when she picks up a single object, abandoned in the snow. It is The Gravedigger`s Handbook, and this is her first act of book thievery. So begins Liesel`s love affair with books and words, and soon she is stealing from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor`s wife`s library . . . wherever there are books to be found. But these are dangerous times, and when Liesel`s foster family hides a Jew in their basement, nothing will ever be the same again. In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time. Now a major film from Twentieth-Century Fox starring Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson. .'
